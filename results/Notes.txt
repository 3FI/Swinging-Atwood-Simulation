First done was 2D with only one mass swinging.
To do so, I used RK4 (explicit).
I tested using mu = 4.5  (ratio of mass) and while there is some degeneracy in the energy, 
it's small enough to consider that the simulation is accurate.
Then, by tracing the path for multiple mu we can compare with the trajectories of wikipedia.
All are good.

Then, I tried making BOTH mass swinging if we set the angle of the large mass to 0 we recover the one mass case.
But if we do it with both, now the degeneracy in energy is significative (around 25%).
Moreover, there seems to be some instability around r=0 as both mass starts to accelerate way too much for 
large initial angle of M or large mu.
A symplectic integrator is probably needed.
